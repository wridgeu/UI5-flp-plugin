# FLP Plugin Session Timeout

This is a slightly refreshed approach to the plugin mentioned by the [SAP Documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/Portal_Service/8422cb487c2146999a2a7dab9cc85cf7/87764543e31247b5b471c06e3f6da6fc.html?locale=en-US). I wanted to have a look at how FLP Plug-In development works in general.

For the purpose or using this Repository as a starting point at any time, I've kept the `getRenderer` function as well as some of the dummy code from the generator.

This Plug-In is supposed to keep the FLP sessions alive by sending small (HTTP HEAD) requests in an interval to the SAP system. Be aware though that before using something like Plug-In development to do this, there are various ways to go about this. One approach could be using the native "Gateway Time-Out Warning" settings explained [here](https://www.saptechnicalguru.com/setting-fiori-gateway-time-out-and-time-out-warning/). Also mentioned in SAP OSS Note [3248472](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3248472) and [2955208](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2955208).

## Activate & Configure the Plug-In

It'd be basically the same as described [here](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_BW4HANA/a7b390faab1140c087b8926571e942b7/d58602924af34fc3816d44ddb6a9e911.html?locale=en-US#activating-and-configuring-the-example-ui-plug-in).

## Open Question

I'm not sure how exactly to '[Make sure that your plug-in is robust if more than one instance is loaded](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_BW4HANA/a7b390faab1140c087b8926571e942b7/1b305d3e6b864e32a9464a13f3076b8b.html?locale=en-US#make-sure-that-your-plug-in-is-robust-if-more-than-one-instance-is-loaded)'. Is it something that is done from within the Plug-In scope itself or do we have to go into the window scope here (i.e. the "sap-ushell-config"?)

As the docs state:
> Even if your plug-in implementation is a singleton by nature, multiple instances might be created due to configuration, and your plug-in must be able to handle this in a robust way.

If you know the answer: DM me anywhere or open an Issue/PR. I'd love to know.

### GetRenderer Impl

Implementation based on this [SO Answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66147223/10323879) and SAP itself (see below image)
